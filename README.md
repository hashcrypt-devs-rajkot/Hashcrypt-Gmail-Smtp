Manytimes magento admin found difficulties in sending email because by default magento uses php mail function which blocked by many hosting providers due tp security reasons. Even if this function is not blocked then many times store email goes to spam.

This module can solve all these issues. Now you can send mail through Gmail SMTP. You just need to add gmail username and password. Thats's all. No blocking. No spam.
